*** For generating visual concepts using the semanticFeature plugin for a particular or batch of images ***
Note: This has been done for all images in the queries folder but this is needed if you are adding new query images (like the Prof's special surprise query image).
Steps:
1.) Copy the surprise query image into the folder "queries"
2.) Generate the text file semanticFeature will use to retrieve the paths of the images to convert to visual concepts.
3.) Run the semanticFeature script on windows CMD manually

Step 1:
Copy into queries directory.

Step 2:
Batch Example: ./write_query_file_paths.py -i ./queries -o batch
Single Example: ./write_query_file_paths.py -i ./queries/0594_2309034355.jpg -o single

Step 3:
Note: Don't use "/", follow the example below and use "\" because of windows CMD
